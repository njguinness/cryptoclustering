# cryptoclustering
Congratulations on Completing Module 19
After all you have learned and practiced in this module, you should be able to:

Recognize the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

Define clustering and how people use it in data analysis.

Apply the K-means algorithm to identify the clusters in a dataset.

Determine the optimal number of clusters for a dataset by using the elbow method.

Preprocess data by normalizing it.

Segment data.

Prepare data for complex algorithms.

Explain the importance of preprocessing and normalizing data for unsupervised learning.

Transform categorical variables into a numerical representation by using Pandas.

Normalize data by using the StandardScaler module from scikit-learn.

Explain what PCA is and how to use it to reduce the dimensionality of data.

Explain how PCA relates to K-means and other applications in machine learning.

Use PCA to reduce the number of features in an unsupervised learning setting.

Take a few minutes to reflect on your learning by considering the following questions:

What new topics did you learn in this module?

How has your understanding changed or evolved?

What are you wondering about?

What questions do you have?
